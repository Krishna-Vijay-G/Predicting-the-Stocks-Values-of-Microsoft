# Predicting Microsoft Stock Values

## Overview

This project aims to predict the stock values of Microsoft using time series analysis techniques. It involves data loading, preprocessing, model building (likely using Keras with a focus on metrics like Root Mean Squared Error), training, and visualization of the results. The code also demonstrates how to filter historical stock data for specific time periods and work with timezones (specifically UTC).

As illustrated below, the project compares the actual Microsoft stock prices with the predicted values over a specific time frame.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

-   **`Predicting the Stocks Values of Microsoft.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete Python code for the project. It includes steps for:
    -   Loading and exploring the Microsoft stock data.
    -   Preprocessing the data (e.g., converting date formats).
    -   Building and compiling a time series forecasting model (likely using a Recurrent Neural Network like LSTM with Keras).
    -   Training the model on historical data.
    -   Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
    -   Making predictions on future stock values (though the provided snippets focus on historical analysis).
    -   Visualizing the historical stock prices and the model's predictions.
    -   Demonstrating how to filter data by date ranges and handle UTC timezones.

## How to Run the Project

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    -   Python 3.x
    -   Jupyter Notebook
    -   Required Python libraries (install using pip):
        ```bash
        pip install pandas matplotlib keras tensorflow pytz
        ```
        You might need to install TensorFlow separately based on your system and GPU availability (e.g., `pip install tensorflow` or `pip install tensorflow-gpu`).

2.  **Save the Image:**
    -   Save the provided image as `actual_vs_predicted.png` in the same directory as your `README.md` file.

3.  **Open the Notebook:**
    -   Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
    -   Run Jupyter Notebook:
        ```bash
        jupyter notebook
        ```
    -   Open the `Predicting the Stocks Values of Microsoft.ipynb` file in your browser.

4.  **Execute the Code:**
    -   Follow the instructions and execute the cells within the Jupyter Notebook sequentially.
    -   The notebook will guide you through the data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and visualization steps.
